# Interact
Created by Daniel Kravec, on July 23, 2021.


## What is this page?
This is the offical GitHub organization for Interact, by Daniel Kravec. 

Interact is a part of Nova Productions, find more info at [novapro.net](https://novapro.net/)


## Interact's Goal
Interact was created to be an open source option in comparsion to twitter. 
I created this project so I could learn more about programming.

Interact's API is free to use by anyone, you just need to sign up for a developer account then make an application on your profile!

Over the next months I hope to work on Interact API's documentation so its easier to understand


## Repository Information
social-frontend-plain is the frontend hosted at [interact.novapro.net](https://interact.novapro.net/)

social-backend is the current backend hosted at [interact-api.novapro.net](https://interact-api.novapro.net/), currently private repo
